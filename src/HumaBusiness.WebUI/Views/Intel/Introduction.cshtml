                        SmartAdmin 4.0 is a Web Application that is based on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and built on top of the latest BootStrap 4 UI Framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the great success of our previous version of SmartAdmin we knew we had to do our utmost best to deliver you the latest and greatest when it comes to Bootstrap based theming.
                        Our journey has not been without challenges and we even decided to completely reboot our approach on not only how we wanted to setup our template, but also provide a much better customer journey with a strong focus on getting your started.
                        Whether you are a seasoned SmartAdmin veteran or a new customer, we got your covered. We retained the unique look and feel of SmartAdmin but brought it up to the newest industry standards, supporting the latest versions of your favorite plugins.
                        Doing more with less, this has been our core motto during the rebuilt of SmartAdmin 4.0 and has helped us to stay focused and keep our promise to deliver this cutting-edge redesign of your favorite Bootstrap template!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Part of the rebuilt was to ensure we would be able to provide better out of the box integrations with the most popular tech-stacks for building web applications.
                        You can head over to the <a asp-controller="Info" asp-action="AppFlavors">App Flavors</a> page to see our current selection of frameworks that will be made available upon release.
                        You can expect these to grow over time as we include more choices that have been requested by our community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SmartAdmin 4.0 is built with full support for <strong>npm</strong> packages and uses <strong>gulp</strong> to build the site structure.
                        All of this with a strong emphasis on automation and testing to ensure that you not only get a fully fledged solution but a solid framework that meets our own high standards for both building and writing applications.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Seed vs Full</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the tradition of SmartAdmin we also include two editions in this version:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SmartAdmin 4.0 - Seed</li>
                        <li>SmartAdmin 4.0 - Full</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As with the previous version our aim here is to provide you with choice. Whether you want it all, or just the bare minimum to get your started.
                        We want to make sure your way of working and how you want to use the template is covered.
                        Want to start from scratch and slowly add your site structure and pages?
                        Then <strong>Seed</strong> will be your best starting point.
                        Planning on building a fully fledged out Management Portal with Dashboards and other cool features?
                        Then <strong>Full</strong> will ensure that you will have all the necessary examples to start building your next big project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time and with each update of SmartAdmin 4.0 we will be extending the amount of functionality to will get added to the <strong>Full</strong> version.
                        After we have established a stable community of users we will launch an initiative to invite you our customers to participate in determining which feature you would like to see implemented as part of the next big SmartAdmin update!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why @Model.Name for @Model.Flavor</h2>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET Core is a developer friendly platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
                        It is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, Internet-connected applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This philosophy suits SmartAdmin and matches our intent on how we want to present it to you our users.
                        Not everyone identifies themselves as a typical user and as such @Model.Name for @Model.Flavor supports both ASP.NET Core MVC as well as ASP.NET Core RazorPages, using C# for server-side logic to provide model-binding and various other scenarios.
                        With ASP.NET Core 3.0 around the corner later this year we decided to use .NET Core 2.2 as the focus of this project.
                        But worry not, once ASP.NET Core 3.0 is fully released we'll be sure to provide you with a sleek update that covers all the newly introduced features to match the capabilities of SmartAdmin.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Build secure apps</h2>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET supports industry standard authentication protocols. Built-in features help protect your apps against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). It is built on top of a lightweight, high-performance, and modular HTTP request pipeline that deploys and runs to Windows, Linux and MacOS!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET provides a built-in user database with support for multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter, and more.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Identity Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have chosen to add support for ASP.NET Core Identity with this version of SmartAdmin to not only give you an out of the box secure experience but also showcase how well we were able to have these two frameworks work together as they were shaped to match the SmartAdmin 4.0 appearance.
                        All of this is resting comfortable on the back of ASP.NET EntityFramework Core which has been setup with Migrations support to get you started.
